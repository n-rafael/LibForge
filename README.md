# About This Repository

THIS FORK IS FOR RESEARCH INTO AMPLITUDE (2016), which (presumably) uses a new version of Forge.

I am keeping track of my research into RB4 customs here.

I am working out the structure of the files in Rock Band 4. These are being documented in the form of 010 Editor Template files, which are in the `010` directory.

# Latest Build

Can be downloaded at [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxton/libforge/branch/master/artifacts)

# LibForge

This is a library I'm working on that handles reading, writing, and converting for formats in the Forge engine used by Rock Band 4 and Rock Band VR.

It is licensed under the GNU LGPLv3 and includes two frontends at the moment:
